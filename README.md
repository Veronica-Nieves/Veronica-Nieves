### Hi! ðŸ‘‹  My name is VerÃ³nica but I prefer you name me Vero

I love mathematics and the logical thinking that it gives me when I learn it. I like to share experiences and learn from others.
I am passionate about highlighting the importance of knowing the why of things and exposing my ideas to create something new, create creative solutions or improve something that already exists.

âš¡My favorite hobbie is playing board games. They are interesting and funny with family, friends, or anyone. 

I invite you to learn more about my professional training on my ORCID profile.
